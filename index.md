Hi welcome to my GitHub website
You can view my GitHub [here](https://github.com/jbethards)
I don't have many repositories at the moment.

-[Python1](https://github.com/jbethards/Python1) repository hosts a trivia game I created on Python.

I plan on adding more solutions and c# files in the near future.
